# Applied Mechanism Design and Big Data course materials

This repository contains labaratory(practical) and theoretical works that were conducted for the Applied Mechanism Design and Big Data course at the University of Amsterdam. 
The code for the practical assignments is written in python as available in the ipython format. 

### Course description
This course aims to teach students a combination of Mechanism Design and Big Data techniques to better understand, predict and influence the behavior of large scale information systems. We will cover the application of mechanism design principles to large scale information systems and the measurability of these systems with Big Data technologies, allowing e.g. analysis of phase transitions (such as the global transition from carbon based energy to renewables). After the course, students are able to understand how to model large scale information systems with mechanism design techniques. They will be able to determine how key parameters in these systems can be measured and analyzed with Big Data technologies and they will be able to participate in the scientific discussion in this emerging field.
